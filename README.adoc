= Eclipse Vert.x GSoC 2018 Assessment App
:toc:
:toc-placement!:

In 2018, the Eclipse Vert.x team proposes subjects for Google Summer of Code through the Eclipse organization.

In addition to the GSoC proposal document, we ask candidates to implement a simple Vert.x application.
This will help us make sure candidates have a basic understanding of asynchronous programming and the Vert.x toolkit.

== The assessment app

This repository contains a skeleton for a "Quotes Of The Day" Vert.x application.
The Maven POM file is setup for you so just fork the repository and start coding.

The application involves a few Vert.x modules: Vert.x Web, Vert.x Unit, JDBC Client.

=== Running

In a terminal, run:

[source,shell]
----
mvn clean vertx:initialize
mvn -pl :web vertx:run
----

This will start the application on port `8080`. Application is redeployed when source code changes.

=== Running tests

In a terminal, run:

[source,shell]
----
mvn test
----

== Tasks

=== Setup and basic retrieval

In `QuoteOfTheDayVerticle` class:

- setup the database (schema and data)
- setup a Vert.x Web `Router`

When the HTTP server is ready, make sure that requests to `/quotes` will return all the quotes from the database in the JSON format.

The `QuoteOfTheDayVerticleTest` unit test will verify this behavior.

=== Post new quotes

Modify your Vert.x Web `Router` so that a `POST` request to `/quotes` allows to insert a new quote in the database.

Quotes must have a text and an author.
If the author is not provided by the user, the application should add the default "Unknown" value.
If the text is not provided, the application should reject the request with `400` status.

Add tests to `QuoteOfTheDayVerticleTest` to verify your code.

=== Realtime quotes

Modify the code so that websocket requests to `/realtime` receive any new quote inserted in the database.

Add tests to `QuoteOfTheDayVerticleTest` to verify your code.

== Submitting code

Please share your implementation by providing a pull request to this repository.

*Do not try to play smart by copying other candidates pull requests.*

In order to ease the review:

* rebase your pull request on `master` regularly
* organize your `git` history to show one commit per task

== Getting help

The http://vertx.io/docs[Vert.x docs] have all the information you need to implement the assessment application.

If you are not sure how to proceed with one or more of the tasks, get in touch with the possible mentors (email links on the https://wiki.eclipse.org/Google_Summer_of_Code_2018_Ideas#Eclipse_Vert.x[Eclipse wiki page for GSoC] or you can https://github.com/tsegismont/vertx-gsoc-2018-qotd/issues/new[file an issue] in this project).
